# TinyTorch: Implementation Reference

> **Status: as-built, contributor-facing.** TinyTorch is a live, already-implemented course and framework. This document is your map for reading and modifying the real source: file paths, line numbers, and representative code pulled directly from the codebase at `dev` HEAD (`7d695104`, 2026-08-12). Read the [design doc](design.md) first for the "what and why"; this doc is the "where and how." Section 11, "Common contribution workflows," is the fastest way in if you already know what you want to change.

## Prerequisites

| To work on... | You need |
|---|---|
| A module's content (`src/<NN_name>/`) or its tests | Python 3.10 or newer, a virtual environment, and `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .` from `tinytorch/`. That's the whole setup; no external services required. |
| The `tito` CLI itself | The same as above. `tito` is a plain Python package (`tito/`) installed alongside `tinytorch/` from the same `pyproject.toml`. |
| The docs site or PDF guide | The above, plus Quarto, and for PDF builds specifically, a LaTeX distribution (CI uses TinyTeX) and the Mermaid CLI for diagrams. |
| The community dashboard (`quarto/community/`) | Node.js and npm for its Playwright test suite; the dashboard itself is plain HTML/CSS/JS with no build step. |
| The VS Code extension (`vscode-ext/`) | Node.js, npm, and the VS Code extension development tools. |
| Instructor grading workflows | The above, plus `nbgrader` installed (`pip install nbgrader`), per `INSTRUCTOR.md`. |

## 1. The module system (`src/`, `modules/`, `tinytorch/`)

### 1.1 A real module source file

`src/01_tensor/01_tensor.py` is a Jupytext "percent format" file: plain Python with `# %%` cell markers, so it round-trips cleanly to and from a Jupyter notebook. Its header declares the jupytext representation, and the file mixes markdown cells (learning objectives, a "Module Dependencies" section, a dependency-flow diagram showing `Module 01 (Tensor) -> All Other Modules`) with code cells.

The nbdev export target is declared once near the top of the file:

```python
#| default_exp core.tensor
```

Every cell that should become part of the installable package is tagged:

```python
#| export
class Tensor:
    ...
```

Implementation gaps students fill in look like this (representative, from the `__init__` region):

```python
# %% nbgrader={"grade": false, "grade_id": "tensor-class", "solution": true}
#| export
class Tensor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        # TODO: Initialize a Tensor by wrapping data in a NumPy array
        ### BEGIN SOLUTION
        self.data = np.asarray(data)
        ...
        ### END SOLUTION
```

When an instructor runs the release pipeline, nbgrader's solution-clearing step removes everything between `### BEGIN SOLUTION` and `### END SOLUTION`, leaving the `TODO:` comment and surrounding scaffolding in place for the student to fill in. The same pattern repeats through the file for `__add__`, `__sub__`, matmul, reshape, transpose, and the reduction operations.

### 1.2 Module metadata

`src/01_tensor/module.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Tensor Foundation
subtitle: Building Blocks of ML
description: Build the foundational Tensor class that powers all machine learning operations.
```

Every module directory under `src/` has one of these; `tito` reads it (via `tito/core/modules.py`) to show titles and descriptions in the CLI without hardcoding them anywhere.

### 1.3 How a module becomes three other things

- **Source to notebook**: `tito/commands/export_utils.py`'s `convert_py_to_notebook()` shells out to `jupytext --to ipynb` to regenerate `modules/<NN_name>/<short_name>.ipynb` from the `src/` `.py` file. `SOURCE_MAPPINGS` in the same file hardcodes which `src/` file feeds which nbdev export target, since the notebook path and the export path aren't always the same string.
- **Notebook to package**: nbdev exports every `#| export`-tagged cell into `tinytorch/`, following the `#| default_exp` target declared in the source file (`core.tensor` becomes `tinytorch/core/tensor.py`). `add_autogenerated_warnings()` (also in `export_utils.py`) injects the "AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!" banner into every generated file, and each generated file carries an nbdev provenance comment (for example `# %% ../../modules/01_tensor/tensor.ipynb #dbd4f042`) pointing back at the exact notebook cell it came from.
- **The command that does this for a student**: `tito module complete <NN>` runs the module's tests, does a syntax check, exports via nbdev, runs relevant integration tests, and updates progress tracking, in that order. Running `tito module test <NN>` alone does *not* export anything; only `complete` updates what's actually importable from `tinytorch`.

### 1.4 Module discovery

`tito/core/modules.py` auto-discovers modules by scanning `src/` for directories matching `^(\d{2})_(\w+)$`, builds the `{"01": "01_tensor", ...}` mapping used throughout the CLI, and reads each module's `module.yaml` for display metadata. Nothing about the module list is hardcoded; adding a 21st module means adding a correctly-named `src/` directory with a `module.yaml`, and the CLI picks it up automatically.

---

## 2. The `tito` CLI (`tito/`)

### 2.1 Architecture (`tito/main.py`)

`TinyTorchCLI` builds one `argparse.ArgumentParser` with subparsers, keyed off a single dictionary mapping top-level command names to command classes. Each top-level command is itself a group that registers its own nested subparser (for example, `module` registers `start`, `test`, `complete`, and so on), so effectively every command in the table below is two levels of `argparse` subcommand.

`run(args)` does some deliberate custom behavior before dispatching: it intercepts `-h`/`--help` to show Rich-formatted help instead of argparse's default, gives a friendlier error for an unrecognized first argument, and (except for `tito setup`) enforces that commands run inside an activated virtual environment unless `TITO_ALLOW_SYSTEM=1` is set, since running the course tooling against a system Python is a common source of confusing failures.

Every command class inherits from the abstract `BaseCommand` (`tito/commands/base.py`), which supplies `config`, a shared Rich `console`, the resolved `venv_path`, and an `execute()` wrapper that catches and formats `TinyTorchCLIError` and generic exceptions consistently.

### 2.2 Command reference

| Command | Class / file | What it actually does |
|---|---|---|
| `tito setup` | `SetupCommand`, `commands/setup.py` | Creates `.venv` (with Apple Silicon/Rosetta detection), installs a fixed toolchain plus `pip install -e .`, registers a `tinytorch` Jupyter kernel, creates `~/.tinytorch/profile.json`, validates the environment, and offers to log in to the community. |
| `tito system info / health / jupyter / update / logo / reset` | `commands/system/*.py` | Environment diagnostics, launching a Jupyter server, checking for CLI updates, showing branding, and resetting the local environment to a pristine state. |
| `tito module start / view / resume / test / complete / reset / status / list / path` | `ModuleWorkflowCommand`, `commands/module/workflow.py` (1,857 lines) plus `commands/module/test.py` and `commands/module/reset.py` | `start` checks sequential prerequisites and opens the module in Jupyter, creating its notebook from `src/` if it doesn't exist yet. `complete` runs the four-step pipeline described in section 1.3. `test` runs the three-phase test check described below without exporting anything. `reset` regenerates a module's notebook from `src/` and clears its progress entries. |
| `tito dev test / preflight / export / build / clean` | `commands/dev/*.py` | `test` is the unified pytest runner CI uses, with flags for `--unit`, `--integration`, `--e2e`, `--cli`, `--milestone`, `--all`, `--release`, or a specific `--module NN`. `preflight` runs pre-release verification (project structure, CLI smoke checks, imports, git state, module tests, milestone scripts, docs). `export` rebuilds the entire curriculum (`src/` to `modules/` to `tinytorch/`) for all modules or one. `build` wraps `make` targets for the site, PDF guide, or paper. `clean` removes build artifacts. |
| `tito package reset / nbdev` | `commands/package/*.py` | `reset package` clears exported package files; `reset all` clears all user progress and data. `nbdev` is a thin wrapper exposing `--export`/`--build-docs`/`--test`/`--clean`, mostly delegating to the underlying nbdev CLI or to `DevExportCommand`. |
| `tito nbgrader init / generate / release / collect / autograde / feedback / status / analytics / report` | `commands/nbgrader.py` | `generate` converts a module's `src/` file to a notebook via jupytext, applies nbgrader cell-metadata validation and solution stripping, and stages it under `assignments/source/`. `release`, `collect`, `autograde`, `feedback`, and `report` are thin wrappers that shell out to the real `nbgrader` CLI. This whole command group is a fully local, offline instructor workflow with no network calls. |
| `tito milestone list / run / info / status / timeline / test / demo` | `commands/milestone.py` | Implements the six hardcoded milestones described in the design doc. `run` executes a milestone's standalone script via a subprocess, after validating that the required module exports actually work. Progress is stored in `.tito/milestones.json`. |
| `tito community login / logout / profile / status / map / sync` | `commands/community.py`, `commands/login.py` | `login`/`logout` run the browser-based auth flow described in section 6 below. `profile` and `map` just open the relevant page on `mlsysbook.ai` in the browser. `status` shows a login-state panel. `sync` is the manual recovery path to upload local progress that wasn't synced automatically. |
| `tito benchmark baseline / capstone` | `commands/benchmark.py` | `baseline` runs quick NumPy micro-benchmarks (tensor ops, matmul, forward pass) and normalizes them into a 0 to 100 score against a hardcoded reference system, saving JSON under `.tito/benchmarks/`. `capstone` scores the student's Module 20 `tinytorch.olympics` submission if it exists, or falls back to a placeholder score otherwise. The "submit to website" step in both is currently a stub. |
| `tito olympics` | `commands/olympics.py` | The not-yet-implemented placeholder described in the design doc. Only its `logo` subcommand does anything real; every other subcommand, including a registered but unimplemented `status`, falls through to a generic "coming soon" message. |

Note: `login`/`logout` are not registered as bare top-level commands in `main.py`'s dispatch table; they're only reachable as `tito community login` / `tito community logout`. Some older documentation and welcome text refers to a bare `tito login`, which doesn't exist as an actual dispatch entry.

### 2.3 `tito/core/` responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `auth.py` | Credential storage at `~/.tinytorch/credentials.json`, plus `AuthReceiver`/`LocalAuthServer`, a local HTTP callback server used during the browser login flow. Defines the backend base URL and endpoints. |
| `browser.py` | Cross-platform "open this URL in the default browser" helper, with WSL, macOS, and Windows-specific strategies and a manual-fallback panel if none of them work. |
| `config.py` | `CLIConfig`, a dataclass of resolved project paths. Auto-detects the project root by walking up the directory tree looking for `pyproject.toml`, and validates the Python version, active virtualenv, required directories, and required packages. |
| `console.py` | A shared Rich `Console` singleton plus banner, logo, error, success, warning, and info print helpers used across the whole CLI. |
| `exceptions.py` | A small exception hierarchy: `TinyTorchCLIError` (base), `ValidationError`, `ExecutionError`, `EnvironmentError`, `ModuleNotFoundError`. |
| `modules.py` | Module auto-discovery and metadata parsing, described in section 1.4. |
| `runtime.py` | Distinguishes `is_ci()` from `is_interactive()` as two explicitly separate checks. See "Project history" in the design doc for why this distinction matters. |
| `status_analyzer.py` | `TinyTorchStatusAnalyzer`, a heavier per-module compliance and health checker (checks for required sections, parses class and function counts, tries importing and running the module) used by dashboards and preflight checks. |
| `submission.py` | `SubmissionHandler`, which assembles progress and milestone data and posts it to the Supabase Edge Function backing community sync, with token-refresh handling on authentication failure. Also owns `auto_sync_after_completion()`, the shared decision point (skip in CI, prompt if interactive, sync silently if already logged in) used after module and milestone completion and after login. |
| `theme.py` | Centralized Rich color and style constants for consistent CLI theming. |
| `virtual_env_manager.py` | Resolves the virtual environment path (respecting a `VENV_PATH` environment variable or a `.tinyrc` config file, defaulting to `.venv`) and the correct binary directory for the current OS. |

### 2.4 What `tito module test <NN>` actually runs

Three phases, in `ModuleTestCommand.test_module()` (`tito/commands/module/test.py`):

1. **Inline tests**: runs `python src/<module>/<module>.py` as a subprocess, which triggers the module's own `if __name__ == "__main__"` block containing quick sanity assertions. Pass or fail is just the subprocess return code.
2. **Module pytest**: if `tests/<module>/` exists, runs `python -m pytest tests/<module> --tinytorch -q --tb=short --no-cov`. The custom `--tinytorch` flag turns on WHAT/WHY educational context in the test output, described in section 3.
3. **Integration tests**: looks up a hardcoded map from module number to relevant files under `tests/integration/` (accumulating tests progressively as module number increases) and runs those.

`--unit-only` stops after phase 1. `--no-integration` skips phase 3. `--all` runs every module in sequence and prints a summary table.

---

## 3. Testing (`tests/`)

### 3.1 Configuration

`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` sets `testpaths = ["tests"]`, standard test discovery patterns, two custom markers (`slow`, `quick`), and `--strict-markers`. There's no coverage plugin configured; the project's own comment notes coverage isn't considered useful for educational code.

The root `tests/conftest.py` (349 lines) does three important things before any test runs:

1. **A package-export pre-flight check**: `_validate_package_exported()`, wired into `pytest_configure`, verifies that `tinytorch/core/{tensor,activations,layers,losses}.py` exist and that `from tinytorch import Tensor` actually imports a working class, not something silently `None`. If it fails, it raises `pytest.UsageError` telling the developer to run `tito dev export --all`, rather than letting every downstream test fail with a confusing import error. Skippable via `TINYTORCH_SKIP_EXPORT_CHECK=1`.
2. Registers the `module(name)`, `slow`, and `integration` markers.
3. A custom `--tinytorch` CLI flag turns on `TinyTorchTestReporter`, which parses WHAT/WHY/STUDENT LEARNING sections out of test docstrings and prints them via Rich, and auto-detects which module a test belongs to from its file path.

### 3.2 Test categories

| Directory | What's tested |
|---|---|
| `tests/<NN_name>/` (one per module) | Standard unit tests for that module's implementation. |
| `tests/cli/` | Black-box tests of the `tito` command itself: bare invocation, `--help`, `--version`, CLI registry consistency, help-text consistency, community and submission flows, and nbgrader-command behavior. Some tests import `tito.main.TinyTorchCLI` directly; others shell out via subprocess to test the real entry point end to end. |
| `tests/e2e/` | Full simulated student journeys, run as `tito` subprocesses with `TITO_ALLOW_SYSTEM=1` set. Marked `quick` (about 30 seconds), `module_flow` (about 2 minutes), or `full_journey` (7 to 8 minutes, CI only). |
| `tests/environment/` | Validates the local dev environment itself: Python version at least 3.10, an active virtualenv, and that core dependencies import correctly. Meant to run right after `tito setup`. |
| `tests/integration/` | Cross-module tests: tensor plus autograd plus layers together, a full training pipeline, CNN integration, gradient flow, and similar. One file, `test_module_integration.py`, is entirely disabled via `pytest.mark.skip` with an explicit comment that it targets stale package paths; current coverage lives in the other, more focused files in the same directory. |
| `tests/milestones/` | Smoke tests that every milestone script under `milestones/` can still be imported and constructed without crashing, parametrized over every `.py` file found there. Explicitly framed as an API-drift catcher between milestone scripts and the module APIs they depend on. |
| `tests/regression/` | Pinned tests documenting specific historical autograd and shape bugs (see the design doc's "Project history" for the actual bugs), so they can't silently reappear. |

---

## 4. Milestones (`milestones/`)

Each milestone directory (for example `milestones/01_1958_perceptron/`) contains its own `README.md` with historical context, plus one or more runnable Python scripts that import the student's real module implementations directly, not mocks or reference solutions. `milestones/data_manager.py` provides shared data-loading utilities across milestones, and `milestones/journey.svg` is a visual map of the milestone progression used in the docs.

`tito milestone run <NN>` executes the milestone's script as a subprocess after validating that the modules it depends on actually export working code, per the requirements table in the design doc.

---

## 5. Documentation site and PDFs (`quarto/`)

### 5.1 The docs site

`quarto/_quarto.yml` is the main website Quarto project, published at `mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch/`. Structure:

- `quarto/modules/01_tensor.qmd` through `20_capstone.qmd`: one hand-authored chapter per module. These are prose pages that link out to the actual notebook (a Binder launch URL pointing at `modules/<NN>/<slug>.ipynb`) and the actual source (a GitHub link to `src/<NN>/<NN>.py`); they are not generated from either. There is no notebook-to-docs conversion script anywhere in the project (confirmed by searching `tito/` and `scripts/` for `nbconvert` or similar, with no matches).
- `quarto/milestones/` and `quarto/tiers/`: narrative pages for the six milestones and the three curriculum tiers (Foundation, Architecture, Optimization).
- `quarto/tito/`: CLI reference documentation.
- `quarto/config/announcement.yml`: the site's announcement banner configuration.
- `quarto/install.sh`: the install script served directly at `mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch/install.sh`.

### 5.2 The PDF guide and the paper

`quarto/pdf/` is a second, separate Quarto book project that reuses the same `.qmd` chapter files from `quarto/modules/` (one directory up) to render a downloadable PDF course guide via LaTeX, built with `make pdf` from `quarto/Makefile`. The TinyTorch research paper (`paper/paper.tex`) is a fully independent LaTeX document, unrelated to the Quarto content, compiled separately via `xu-cheng/latex-action` in CI.

### 5.3 The community dashboard

`quarto/community/` is a distinct sub-feature: an interactive student-progress dashboard, including a 3D "globe" visualization, built as plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (`dashboard.html`, `community.html`, supporting pages for profile setup and auth callbacks, and a `community/modules/` directory of JS for auth, camera, terrain, and UI rendering). It's published by Quarto only as a static-resource passthrough, not authored in `.qmd`, and has its own Playwright end-to-end test suite under `quarto/community/community/tests/`.

---

## 6. Community sync and authentication

`tito login` (reached via `tito community login`) starts a short-lived local HTTP server, opens the browser to the TinyTorch website's `cli-login` endpoint at `https://tinytorch.netlify.app`, and waits up to 300 seconds for the browser to redirect back to `localhost:<port>/callback` with an access token, a refresh token, and an email address as query parameters. On success, tokens are saved to `~/.tinytorch/credentials.json`, and the user is offered a one-time sync of any progress completed before logging in.

Progress sync itself (`SubmissionHandler` in `tito/core/submission.py`) assembles `.tito/progress.json` and `.tito/milestones.json` into a payload and posts it, with bearer-token authentication and automatic token-refresh retry on a 401, to a Supabase Edge Function. This is a separate backend from the Netlify-hosted login flow: login authenticates the user against the website, while progress data itself is stored via Supabase.

This whole system exists for two purposes: keeping a student's personal dashboard and profile current, and (eventually) powering leaderboard submissions. It's never required to actually complete the course; every module and milestone completion is tracked locally first regardless of login state.

---

## 7. Packaging

### 7.1 `pyproject.toml` (at `tinytorch/`)

Declares `name = "tinytorch"`, current version `0.1.13`, `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, MIT license, and runtime dependencies limited to `numpy`, `rich`, `PyYAML`, `certifi`, and `pytest`. `[project.scripts]` registers `tito = "tito.main:main"` as the installed console command. Optional dependency groups: `dev` (pytest plus coverage, jupytext, nbformat, jupyter, jupyterlab, ipykernel, and a pinned nbdev range), `visualization` (matplotlib), and `docs` (jupyter-book, sphinxcontrib-mermaid, matplotlib, and Jupyter widgets). `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` limits the built package to the `tinytorch` and `tito` packages, explicitly excluding `tests`, `modules`, `site`, `docs`, `milestones`, and `assignments`.

### 7.2 `settings.ini`

The classic nbdev settings file (fastai-derived format). Repeats some of the same metadata as `pyproject.toml` (`lib_name = tinytorch`, `version = 0.1.13`, `min_python = 3.10`, MIT license) but with its own, looser `requirements`/`dev_requirements` lines (for example `numpy>=1.20.0` here versus `numpy>=2.2.6,<3.0.0` in `pyproject.toml`), a known drift risk between the two files since nothing currently keeps them mechanically in sync beyond the version-bump step in the publish workflow. Also configures the nbdev paths (`lib_path = tinytorch`, `nbs_path = modules`, `doc_path = _docs`) and docs metadata (`doc_host`, `doc_baseurl`, `git_url`, `title`).

### 7.3 `MANIFEST.in`

Seven lines: includes `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `pyproject.toml` explicitly, recursively includes every `.py` file under `tinytorch/`, and excludes `__pycache__`, compiled `.pyc`/`.pyo` files, and `.DS_Store` everywhere. It doesn't explicitly list `tito/`'s files; those are picked up via setuptools' package auto-discovery instead.

### 7.4 Distribution

TinyTorch is not currently published to PyPI by any automated workflow; see "Known issues" in the design doc for the discrepancy between this and what `CONTRIBUTING.md` claims. Distribution is via git tags (`tinytorch-vX.Y.Z`) and GitHub Releases, created by `tinytorch-publish-live.yml`.

---

## 8. CI/CD implementation notes

### 8.1 `tinytorch-validate-dev.yml`: the required gate

Triggers on push to `dev` (paths under `tinytorch/**`), on pull requests targeting `main` or `dev`, and via `workflow_call` (used as the preflight step inside the publish workflow). Runs as an 8-stage job graph, matrixed across `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-2022`: configure, build the package from source, then in parallel unit tests, integration tests, and CLI tests, then end-to-end tests gated on those three, then a Docker-based fresh-install simulation (skipped on fork pull requests) and a destructive full user-journey stage (only run for `all`/`user-journey` test types), then a non-blocking link check over the Quarto `.qmd` source, then a summary. Every stage runs through `./bin/tito dev test --<stage> --ci`, the same unified test runner contributors use locally.

### 8.2 `tinytorch-preview-dev.yml`

Triggers automatically once "Validate (Dev)" succeeds on `dev`, or manually. Builds the PDFs (via the reusable `tinytorch-build-pdfs.yml`), builds the docs site with Quarto, injects the built PDFs and downloaded slide decks, rewrites URLs for the dev preview subpath, runs a visual smoke test against the index and preface pages, then SSH-deploys into a separate dev-preview repository.

### 8.3 `tinytorch-publish-live.yml`: production

Manual only, gated behind typing `PUBLISH` to confirm. Computes the next semantic version from existing `tinytorch-v*` tags with a no-downgrade guard against the current `pyproject.toml` version, re-runs the full validate workflow as a preflight, bumps the version across `pyproject.toml`, `settings.ini`, `quarto/install.sh`, the README badge, and a version chip in the sidebar, merges `dev` into `main`, builds PDFs, builds and deploys the site to the `gh-pages` branch's `tinytorch/` subdirectory, and finally creates the version tag and a draft GitHub Release.

### 8.4 `tinytorch-build-pdfs.yml` and `tinytorch-update-pdfs.yml`

`build-pdfs` is a reusable workflow with two independent jobs, one building the Quarto-based PDF guide (via TinyTeX and the Mermaid CLI) and one compiling the separate LaTeX research paper, both uploaded as artifacts for the calling workflow to use. `update-pdfs` is a manual-only, PDF-only path: it rebuilds just the guide and/or paper and pushes the updated files directly into `gh-pages`, without touching the site build, the version number, or creating a release.

---

## 9. Local development setup

1. `cd tinytorch`, create and activate a virtual environment.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `pip install -e .` to install both `tinytorch` and `tito` in editable mode.
3. Verify with `tito --version`, `tito system health`, and `tito module status`.
4. Work on module content directly in `src/<NN_name>/<NN_name>.py`, the source of truth; never hand-edit files under `modules/`, since those are regenerated. After a change, run `tito dev export` (or `tito module complete <NN>` if you also want it reflected in progress tracking) to see it as an importable part of `tinytorch`.
5. Test with `pytest tests/<NN_name>/` or `tito module test <NN>` for a single module, `pytest tests/integration/` for cross-module checks, and, if your change affects one, the relevant milestone script under `milestones/`.
6. Follow the mandatory git workflow from `CONTRIBUTING.md`: never commit directly to `dev` or `main`; branch as `feature/your-improvement`; stage files explicitly rather than using a blanket `git add .`; open a PR targeting `dev`.

For instructor-side grading workflows specifically, `INSTRUCTOR.md` documents the full `tito nbgrader init` through `report` sequence, plus a 16-week sample course schedule and a grading rubric (roughly 70% auto-graded, 30% manually-graded "ML Systems Thinking" reflection questions).

---

## 10. Known-broken or inaccurate as of this document

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Release Process" section claims the release workflow "deploys to tinytorch.org" and "publishes to PyPI." Neither matches the actual `tinytorch-publish-live.yml` workflow, which deploys to `mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch/` via `gh-pages` and has no PyPI step at all.
- `tinytorch/scripts/build-docs.sh` references a defunct Jupyter Book pipeline (`docs/_build/html`, `website/docs/`) that predates the current Quarto site, and is not called from any current CI workflow.
- `tests/integration/test_module_integration.py` is fully disabled (`pytest.mark.skip`) with a comment that it targets stale package paths.
- `settings.ini` and `pyproject.toml` specify different dependency version floors for the same package; nothing currently enforces they stay consistent beyond the manual version-bump step in the publish workflow.
- `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest entry is `[0.1.10]` (dated 2026-04, marked "planned"); `pyproject.toml`'s actual `version` is `0.1.13` as of this document, at least three releases with no changelog entry.
- `INSTRUCTOR.md` documents `tito module status --student student_id` and `--export class_progress.csv`; the real `status` subparser takes no arguments and both would fail with an argparse error.
- `quarto/tito/troubleshooting.qmd` references a `tinytorch.nn` submodule (`from tinytorch.nn import Linear`) that doesn't exist; the real path is `tinytorch.core.layers`. The same file's `overview.qmd` sibling omits `tito package`, `tito olympics`, and `tito module path` from its command reference table, despite all three being real, registered commands.

---

## 11. Common contribution workflows

### Improving a module's content or exercises

1. Edit `src/<NN_name>/<NN_name>.py` directly. Preserve the `#| default_exp` / `#| export` structure and the `### BEGIN SOLUTION` / `### END SOLUTION` markers around any region a student is meant to implement themselves.
2. `tito dev export --module <NN>` (or `--all` if you touched shared code) to regenerate the student notebook and the compiled package.
3. `tito module test <NN>` to run that module's own three-phase test check.
4. If your change affects behavior other modules or milestones depend on, run `pytest tests/integration/` and any relevant `tito milestone run <NN>` to check for downstream breakage; this project has a real history of exactly that kind of drift (see the design doc's "Project history").
5. Open a PR against `dev` following the git workflow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Fixing a bug in the `tito` CLI

1. Locate the relevant command class (Section 2.2's table) or core module (Section 2.3's table).
2. Make the fix. If it involves environment detection, subprocess behavior, or anything platform-specific, test on both a Unix shell and Windows if you can; this codebase has a documented history of Windows-specific bugs in exactly this kind of code (see `tito/core/runtime.py`'s CI-versus-interactive fix in the design doc's "Project history").
3. Add or update a test in `tests/cli/`. Prefer testing through the real subprocess entry point (`python -m tito.main ...`) when you're testing user-facing behavior, and importing `tito.main.TinyTorchCLI` directly when you're testing internal logic.
4. `pytest tests/cli/` locally, then open a PR. CI's `tinytorch-validate-dev.yml` runs the CLI test stage on both Ubuntu and Windows.

### Adding or fixing a milestone

1. Milestones live in `milestones/<NN_year_name>/`, each with its own `README.md` and runnable script that imports the student's real module classes.
2. If you're changing a module's public API in a way that could affect a milestone that depends on it, check `tests/milestones/test_milestones_smoke.py` and consider running the affected milestone directly; this is the exact class of bug that test file exists to catch (see GitHub issue #1278, referenced in the design doc).
3. Update the milestone's requirement list in `tito/commands/milestone.py`'s `MILESTONE_SCRIPTS` if the set of prerequisite modules changes.

### Working on the docs site or PDF guide

1. Docs pages live under `quarto/modules/`, `quarto/milestones/`, and `quarto/tiers/`, hand-authored `.qmd` files, not generated from module source. If you add or substantially change a module, remember to update its corresponding `.qmd` page yourself; nothing does this automatically, and nothing currently fails a build if it goes stale.
2. Preview locally with Quarto's own render/preview commands from within `quarto/`, or use `tito dev build` to build via the project's `make` targets.
3. PDF-specific changes (the guide or the paper) can be tested locally if you have a LaTeX distribution installed; CI verifies them via `tinytorch-build-pdfs.yml` on every relevant change.
